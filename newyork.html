        	<div class="newyork-about text-block"> <p>During spring break of 2020 I took a trip to New York City with my friend Rich. We stayed with our friends Sameer and Tyler. It was my first time ever being in New York. We spent our time eating food like pizza and sandwiches from bodegas. Despite the precarious streets of a crowded cosmopolis during a near-pandemic, we ventured to places like the Brooklyn Museum and Anthology Film Archives. Most of the photos in this gallery are from the Brooklyn Museum.</p> </div>

          <div class="newyork-texting text-block"> <p>I used our trip to the Brooklyn Museum as a way to experiment with different compositions—an exercise for my own improvement. I think that photography is up there with poetry when it comes to art that is really tricky to get right. The naivety bursts through if your confidence isn’t in the right place. I decided to do what I thought was the only thing I really could do and embrace the naivety. I just took a bunch of pictures of Rich and tried to make him look cool among all of these artifacts, some of which date back to 5th century B.C.E. What I like about these photographs is how often I captured him gazing into his phone. Even though we were at a museum where, I assume, one main intention is to mill around observing art from different corners of the earth, he chose to look at his phone. I think that’s OK. People prioritize information—which information they place value on above other information. That’s what museums do too, right? A main function of their existence is determining which texts and objects are important, which consequently assigns their value. I like capturing the contrast between the small scope, with Rich, and the large scope, with an institution's cultural preservation and conservation.</p> </div>
